# PowerShell-Full-Computer-Backup
Use wbadmin to write bare metal backups to an external drive and encrypt it.

Quick and simple script that will perform a full bare metal backup of a Windows computer to an encrypted external hard drive. Not a proper backup solution, but can be useful if you ever need to restore as a result of hardware failure or data loss.
